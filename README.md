# DHask ðŸ§ 

**DHask** is DevStacksâ€™ rebranded fork of [GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)](https://github.com/ghc/ghc), designed to fit into the DevStacks developer ecosystem via [DLangSDK](https://github.com/DevStacks-io/DLangSDK).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What is DHask?

DHask brings all the power of Haskellâ€™s advanced type system, functional purity, and laziness into the DevStacks Universe. It is fully aligned with our mission to give developers lightweight, language-diverse tools without vendor lock-in.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features (inherited from GHC)

- Static, strong, and expressive type system
- Laziness by default
- Type inference and pattern matching
- Concurrency and STM

---

## ðŸ§± Integration

Use [DLangSDK](https://github.com/DevStacks-io/DLangSDK) to launch `dhask` from a unified cross-platform compiler interface.

DHask is part of the [HobbyStack](https://github.com/DevStacks-io/HobbyStack), which includes functional and experimental languages supported by DevStacks.
